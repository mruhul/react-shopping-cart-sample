# react-shopping-cart-sample
A sample implementation of shopping cart using reactjs, postal.js. For client side script source please have a look at "Src\ReactBookStore.Web\ClientSrc" folder.

## steps to run
- Make sure you build your visual studio solution to make the api works.
- You need to install node
- You need to install npm in global scope
- You need to install bower and bower-installer in global scope
- Make sure you run all your commands from "src" folder
- run npm install
- run bower install
- run gulp
- you can click the batch file in root directory named "start-web.bat" to start the app in iisexpress on port 8081
- Now you should able to browse the site "localhost:8081"

## Note
The demo application using cache for cart. So if two persons using same site then both of them actually using same cart. Which is totally wrong in real world.
